### Beyond that, I have three school projects you are welcome to investigate. The first is the result of my experience working in an agile team in the Software Engineering course at CSU, it is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-crane-623245290/"> hosted </a>. by one of my team members. In this app you can click on a map to create points to create a trip, and then optimize the trip to be shorter, as well as other various features.
### The second is my [Final Project]https://github.com/ncrane3d/lawyers) for Web Development at CSU, which was a group project to create an color coordinate page that is used in certain therapies. There is a database of colors that can be adjusted, and a mock print view created with JS.
### The third is [Communicait](https://github.com/ncrane3d/CommuniCait-App), an app I developed and led a team for, as a part of a project management course at CSU. It is mostly a prototype to show a better solution for the tools nonverbal individuals use, there are more details in the readme of the repo.
