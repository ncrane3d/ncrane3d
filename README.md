### Welcome! Thanks for checking out my page :)
## I am currently looking for software engineering internships for the Summer of 2024. Feel free to contact me on linked in, or at nathan.crane@colostate.edu
## As well as that, feel free to investigate [Communicait](https://github.com/ncrane3d/CommuniCait-App), an app I developed and led a team for, as a part of a project management course at CSU.
