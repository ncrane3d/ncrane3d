### Beyond that, I have three school projects you are welcome to investigate. The first is the result of my experience working in an agile team in the Software Engineering course at CSU, it is <a href="https://cs314.cooperhlarson.com"> hosted </a> by one of my team members. In this app you can click on a map to create points to create a trip, and then optimize the trip to be shorter, as well as other various features.
### The second is the [CSU Hackathon](https://github.com/USDA-OCIO-EDMC/CSU-Hackathon2025/tree/Team8), which was a 24 hour coding challenged sponsored by the USDA and NASA. Our task was to create an AI model to interpret LIDAR data and determine where roads exist in our national forests. During the project our team focused heavily on data cleaning and normalization to ensure that our model was as accurate as possible. We designed our model to use three seperate channels of information, then trained it to weight the results of the different channels as it tried to determine road mapping.
### The third is my [Final Project](https://github.com/ncrane3d/lawyers) for Web Development at CSU, which was a group project to create a color coordinate page that is used in certain therapies. There is a database of colors that can be adjusted, and a mock print view created with JS.
