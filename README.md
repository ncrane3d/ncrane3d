# Welcome! Thank you for visting my profile
### This December I will graduate Colorado State University with a Computer Science degree and a Business Administration minor. As a developer, I practice clear, eloquent communication, constant technical growth, and a strong attention to detail. With my business knowledge, I seek to understand the position that a software engineer plays in the broader structure of a business. As well as that, I aim to be an eager mentee and to uplift those around me. 
### If you would like to look through my work, please see the [Union Election Stats](https:/github.com/ncrane3d/UnionElectionStats) repository. It is the result of a months long agile project to better visualize the decline and affects of reduced rates of union elections.
### Beyond that, feel free to explore my submission for the 2025 [CSU Hackathon](https://github.com/USDA-OCIO-EDMC/CSU-Hackathon2025/tree/Team8), or a <a href="https://cs314.cooperhlarson.com"> Trip Planning </a> app I developed as part of my coursework at csu.
